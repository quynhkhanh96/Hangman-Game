 This game is a problem set from MITx course so that means I just did 80% of the job to implement it because there were helper functions with their specification written in each function's docstring. I did finish up writting those function with their functionality satisfied and then the rest of the work. 
 This is an interactive game:
 - At the start of the game, let the user know how many letters the computer's word contains.
 - Ask the user to supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.
 - The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess about whether their guess appears in the computer's word.
 - After each round, display to the user the partially guessed word so far, as well as letters that the user has not yet guessed.
 Some additional rules of the game:
 - A user is allowed 8 guesses. Make sure to remind the user of how many guesses s/he has left after each round. Assume that players will only ever submit one character at a time (A-Z).
 - A user loses a guess only when s/he guesses incorrectly.
 - If the user guesses the same letter twice, do not take away a guess - instead, print a message letting them know they've already guessed that letter and ask them to try again.
 - The game should end when the user constructs the full word or runs out of guesses. If the player runs out of guesses (s/he "loses"), reveal the word to the user when the game ends.
